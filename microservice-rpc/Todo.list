1. Introduce zookeeper
   1.1 registry
   1.2 loadbalance
   
2. Client API encapsulation

3. Introduce OAuth

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)
Authentication is proving that a user is who they say they are.

OAuth2 isn’t meant to do stuff like validate a user’s identity — that’s taken care of by an Authentication service. Authentication is when you validate a user’s identity (like asking for a username / password to log in), 
whereas authorization is when you check to see what permissions an existing user already has.

provider是可以独立运行的，jar里面有assembly目录，运行mvn assembly:directory就可以生成能直接运行的provider目录
